### day 1
First day of the project I had to think about an application idea. This means of course a main idea, but also have to think ahead on how to build the application. My first idea was a flower recognition app. App should enable users to make a picture of a flower and app will show info of the flower. However, I find out that it is incredible hard to recognize a flower with the availabe software out there. So I switched my idea to a fitness related app, more specific for strength training. Therefore I made a proposal about this new app idea.
