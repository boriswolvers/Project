## Project process - Minor Programmeren
  
    Name:   Boris Wolvers
    App:    Workout app (I still have to think about an appropriate name)
  
### day 1
First day of the project I had to think about an application idea. This means of course a main idea, but also have to think ahead on how to build the application. My first idea was a flower recognition app. App should enable users to make a picture of a flower and app will show info of the flower. However, I find out that it is incredible hard to recognize a flower with the availabe software out there. So I switched my idea to a fitness related app, more specific for strength training. Therefore I made a proposal about this new app idea.

### day 2
Second day I build the navigation drawer of the app with the right intents, thought about the design and made this process.md. Also made cardviewitems and a recyclerviewer in the mainactivity of the app.

### day 3 
Start the day with a meeting with fellow team members. Proposed our ideas to eachother and gave constructive feedback. We also made a fantastic group selfie. Then we worked on our design.md. 
Later in the day I filled the cardviews with the programs.
